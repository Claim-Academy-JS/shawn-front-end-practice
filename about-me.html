<p>
  My name is <em>Humphreys</em>and I am from Manchester, Missouri just west of the beautiful city of <strong>Saint Louis</strong>. I started my programming journey started in 2012 when I started a high school course called Robotics. Throughout the course, I had to partner with one person to build a robot out of parts kit and legos in order to do tasks such as;
  <ol>
    <li>Follow a blank line</li>
    <li> look around</li>
    <ol>
      <li>While looking around, if you see something close, turn 180 degrees and walk away</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  The reason why my team was so successful was because I was already interested in learning code and my partner wasn't into programming, but he loves working with his hands. This made the tasks for both of us simple.
  <ul>
    <li>I operated the brain</li>
    <li>He built the robot to do the tasks</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Fast forward to eight years and several failed career attempts later, I am proud to say I will be pursuing a career in web development with an __amazing__ program at Claim Academy. The program will be <strike>hard</strike> difficult, I got my biggest motivator to keep the energy alive! One month before I started the program, I was informed I will be an uncle to a beautiful baby boy!
